###For the purposes of this project, the files in the Inertial Signals folders are not used. The files that will be used to load data are listed as follows:

test/subject_test.txt
test/X_test.txt
test/y_test.txt
train/subject_train.txt
train/X_train.txt
train/y_train.txt

##So we will use Activity, Subject and Features as part of descriptive variable names for data in data frame.
1.Values of Varible Activity consist of data from “Y_train.txt” and “Y_test.txt”
2.values of Varible Subject consist of data from “subject_train.txt” and subject_test.txt"
3.Values of Varibles Features consist of data from “X_train.txt” and “X_test.txt”
4.Names of Varibles Features come from “features.txt”
5.levels of Varible Activity come from “activity_labels.txt”


* First, all the similar data is merged using the `rbind()` and 'cbind() function. By similar, we address those files having the same number of columns and referring to the same entities.
* Then, only those columns with the mean and standard deviation measures are taken from the whole dataset. After extracting these columns, they are given the correct names, taken from `features.txt`.
* As activity data is addressed with values 1:6, we take the activity names and IDs from `activity_labels.txt` and they are substituted in the dataset.
* On the whole dataset, those columns with vague column names are corrected.
* Finally, we generate a new dataset with all the average measures for each subject and activity type (30 subjects * 6 activities = 180 rows). The output file is called `averages_data.txt`, and uploaded to this repository.

# Variables

* `x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`, `y_test`, `subject_train` and `subject_test` contain the data from the downloaded files.
* `x_data`, `y_data` and `subject_data` merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
* `features` contains the correct names for the `x_data` dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in `mean_and_std_features`, a numeric vector used to extract the desired data.
* A similar approach is taken with activity names through the `activities` variable.
* `all_data` merges `x_data`, `y_data` and `subject_data` in a big dataset.
* Finally, `averages_data` contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a `.txt` file. `ddply()` from the plyr package is used to apply `colMeans()` and ease the development.
